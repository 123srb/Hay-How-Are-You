# Hay-How-Are-You


A journaling and self analysis program

I wanted a program I could use from a Dropbox of Drive that I could do journalling in securely and still be able to customize.  

It currently uses Fernet encryption for stored values, but I may change that later.


# Basic Use
When first run, it will create a key file to encrypt and decrypt your data in your Documents folder (at some point I'll add the ability to specify location)

From there you need to create the fields you want in your form.


# Next Steps
This is V1, you can journal to your hearts content, and there are some very basic analysis function.  I'm going to add more predictive abilities in the future.
